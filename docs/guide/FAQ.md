# FAQ (Frequently asked questions)

* **Q** Why I can't install BenchmarkDotNet in Visual Studio 2010/2012/2013?  
 **A**
BenchmarkDotNet requires NuGet 3.x+ and can't be installed in old versions of Visual Studio which use NuGet 2.x.
Consider to use Visual Studio 2015/2017 or [Rider](http://jetbrains.com/rider/).
